	Fighting Championship (ONE FC) until January 2015) is a multinational combat
	sports promotion founded on 14 July 2011 by Chatri Sityodtong and Victor

	expanded to regularly hold events featuring Muay Thai, kickboxing, and
	submission grappling bouts, while also previously promoting boxing and
	Lethwei matches. One held its first event on 3 September 2011 at the
	Singapore Indoor Stadium, and has since held over 200 events across Asia.
