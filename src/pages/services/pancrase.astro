<Base playlistId={"UU2ENxhP3eiSmkLUa3aax7AA"} title={"PANCRASE"}>
	Pancrase is a Japanese mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion company based in
	Tokyo. It was founded in 1993 by professional wrestlers Masakatsu Funaki and
	Minoru Suzuki. The name was based on pankration, a fighting sport in the
	Ancient Olympic Games. Suzuki and Funaki practiced catch wrestling. They
	based the promotion and its rules on professional wrestling. The promotion's
	champions were called "King of Pancrase". The rules allowed closed-fisted
	punches, except to the head, and palm strikes to the head. A wrestler must
	break a submission hold when the opponent reaches the ropes, but a wrestler
	who claims a rope break loses a point. A wrestler who claims a specified
	number of rope breaks (between 3 and 5) was disqualified. From 1998 to 2000,
	the promotion changed its rules to resemble other mixed martial arts
	promotions.
