	Premier Boxing Champions (PBC) is an ongoing series of televised boxing
	events connected to manager Al Haymon. PBC was initially promoted as an
	effort to return boxing to mainstream broadcast and cable television, as
	opposed to premium channels and pay-per-view. The first Premier Boxing
	Champions card was broadcast by NBC on March 7, 2015, and the promotion
	reached deals with an array of other broadcasters, with brokered cards
	scheduled across all four of the major television networks in the United
	States (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC) and their affiliated sports-oriented cable
	networks (ESPN, CBS Sports Network, FS1, and NBCSN, respectively), as well
	as on outlets such as Spike and Bounce TV.
